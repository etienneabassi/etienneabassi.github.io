## Tactile Perception of Music

This project explores how **tactile stimulation** can enhance the way we perceive and feel music. We're using both scientific and artistic approaches to understand:

- How the brain integrates touch and sound
- The potential of tactile feedback in music accessibility
- Applications in neurodivergent and hearing-impaired populations

We're currently developing a wearable prototype and testing it with musicians and non-musicians alike.

## Influence of social and syntactic contexts in processing musical conversations
