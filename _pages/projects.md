## ** Enhancing Music Perception Through Vibrotactile Feedback.

This project explores how **tactile stimulation** can enhance the way we **perceive and feel music**. We're using both scientific and artistic approaches to understand:

- How the brain **integrates touch and sound**
- Potential of tactile feedback in **music accessibility**
- Applications in **producing music with optimized low frequencies** delivering to the body

We're currently developing a wearable prototype and testing it with musicians and non-musicians alike.



## ** Influence of social context and musical syntax in processing musical conversations

This project explores how **social context and musical structure** influence the way we process music. Our goals include:

- Exploring how **musical interactions** support perception, similar to conversations in speech
- Studying how the structure of music helps the brain **predict and organize sound**
- Highlighting music as a tool for studying **general principles of communication**
