## About Me

I hold a bachelor degree in Neurosciences and Behavioral Sciences from the University of Caen, as well as a Master degree in Psychology and Neuropsychology from the University of Montpellier. Following that, I pursued a Ph.D. at the Institute of Cognitive Neurosciences Marc Jeannerod ( University of Lyon), under the supervision of Dr. Liuba Papeo. In December 2022, I joined the Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory as a Postdoctoral Fellow under the supervsion of Prof. Robert Zatorre, where my research focuses on the vibrotactile perception of music in the brain. My research methods encompass behavioral and fMRI approaches, complemented by the application of machine learning tools. Outside of the lab, I am also an accordion player and an electronic music producer.

## Current Research

I currently explore how **tactile and auditory signals** can enhance perception of **music and language**, especially under noisy or degraded conditions.  

This includes developing tools for **tactile music rendering**, with implications for accessibility, live performance, and cognitive integration of multisensory information.

## Workshops & Artistic Practice

Outside of academia, I create and lead workshops combining **brain science, music, and technology** â€” often featured in festivals and cultural spaces.  

> **Brain, Bass & Music** is a recurring hands-on experience where participants explore how the brain perceives rhythm, vibration, and multisensory input.
