## Current Research

I currently study how **tactile perception** can enhance auditory perception of **music and language**, especially under noisy or degraded conditions.  

This includes developing and testing tools for **tactile music rendering**, with implications for accessibility, live performance, and cognitive integration of multisensory information.

## Workshops & Artistic Practice

Outside of academia, I animate workshops on the topics of **brain science, music, and technology**, often featured in festivals and cultural spaces, as well as giving musical performances. 

## About Me

<div style="text-align: justify;">I hold a bachelor degree in Psychology and Neuropsychology from the University of Montpellier (France), as well as a Master degree in Neurosciences and Behavioral Sciences from the University of Caen (France). Following that, I pursued a Ph.D. in Neurosciences at the Institute of Cognitive Neurosciences Marc Jeannerod ( University of Lyon, France), under the supervision of Dr. Liuba Papeo. In December 2022, I joined the Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at McGill University (Canada) as a Postdoctoral Fellow under the supervsion of Prof. Robert Zatorre, where my current research focuses on the vibrotactile perception of music in the brain. My research methods encompass behavioral and fMRI approaches, complemented by the application of machine learning tools. Outside of the lab, I am also an accordion player and an electronic music producer.</div>
